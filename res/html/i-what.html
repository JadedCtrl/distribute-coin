<h1>Er, what <em>is</em> this?</h1>

<p>Another generic, privacy-centered file-host.</p>
<p>Well, except that this one is backed by <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a>,
the Interplanetary File System-- so your files are permanent and distributed!
Whenever you upload a file, you get an alias (AKA, shortened URL) that redirects
to the file on IPFS.</p>

<h2>And the software?</h2>
<p>coinsh.red runs on what I call
   <a href="https://git.eunichx.us/distribute-coin">distribute-coin</a>,
   a libre/copyleft web service (licensed under the GNU AGPLv3)
   written in Common Lisp. It's the successor to
   <a href="https://git.eunichx.us/insert-coin">insert-coin</a>, which
   just suckeddd.
