<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>No data based on visits are recorded, period. No logs are stored, no IP
   addresses are recorded, and no-one can be tied to any specific file-upload.
</p>

<p>The only data saved is what you explicitly provide:
	<ul>
		<li>Metadata embedded in the file</li>
		<li>The file-name you provide</li>
		<li>The optional “Source” text</li>
	</ul>
</p>

No cookies are used, except for the “LANG” cookie, which is only
created when you manually change the language from the default as detected.
You'll be warned when that happens, ofc.

<h2>Privacy Tips</h2>
<p>To keep safe on coinsh.red (and, y'know, the web in general), try some of
this:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Use <a href="https://torproject.org">Tor</a>
		    and Tor Browser
			<ul>
				<li>coinsh.red has a Tor hidden service you
				    can use
				    <a href="http://4wxnumwn5zljjkyi.onion/">
				    here</a>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Run LiGNUx, instead of <a
		    href="https://gnu.org/proprietary/malware-microsoft.html">
		    Windows</a> or
		    <a href="https://gnu.org/proprietary/malware-apple.html">
		    OSX</a>
		</li>
		<li>Scrape metadata from files you upload whenever possible
			<ul>
				<li>Including here. PNG and JPG files are
				    automatically scraped, but you'll need to
				    manually take care of other filetypes
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

<p>That's really just some bare-bones stuff.</p>
