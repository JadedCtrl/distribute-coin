<h1>The “Terms”</h1>

<p>Basically anything you upload is fair game.</p>

<p>If I get a letter from authorities or what have you (DMCA, etc.), though,
   there's a good chance I'll remove the alias to your file, and unpin it
   from my IPFS gateway.
</p>

<p>You might wanna check out the <a href="privacy">privacy policy</a> page,
   while you're at it.

	<p>(Have I mentioned how much I hate these detached, jargony terms:
	   “terms of service”, “privacy policy”,
	   etc? I'm not saying they're not important, they are, but it feels
	   kind of weird how they're almost always named exactly the same way
	   everywhere, that unsettling homogeneity. Oh well.)
